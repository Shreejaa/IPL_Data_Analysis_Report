    "## Introduction: \n",
    "- Every year starting from 2008, India has been conducting the Indian Premier League(IPL), where it picks up all the players from different countries and selects about fifteen players per team. There are about 12 active teams in the IPL which are Chennai Super Kings(CSK), Sunrisers Hyderabad(SRH), Delhi Champions(DC), Royal Challenges Bangalore(RCB), Kochi Tuskers(Kochi), Kings XI Punjab(KXIP), Kolkata Knight Riders(KKR), Gujarat Lions(GL), Rajasthan Royals(RR), Rising Pune Supergiant(RPS), Mumbai Indians(MI) and Sahara Pune Warriors(PWI).\n",
    "- Before the matches begin, Main Cricket Tournament leaders work on analyzing teams, and based on that; they pick up players for each group. Thus, every year few players keep shuffling.\n",
    "- The cricket ambassadors examine each team based on the data formed by all the previous matches. Depicting different visualization based on the data analysis on each IPL team in two categories: batting and bowling can solve this problem by analyzing data to find the best players and matches played by each team.\n",
    "- This analysis are prepared using **panel** for creating a dashboard and plots are designed using **matplotlib and seaborn**. Two custom designs are build on top of scatter plot and networkx graph."
